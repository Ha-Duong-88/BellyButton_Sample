# Belly Button Biodiversity Project

# Project Overview
The objective of this project was to build customisable and interactive dashboards to visualize the analysis of a study performed on Operational Taxonomic units (OTUs), a species of micro organisms present in humans.

The project involved using Plotly.js and D3 JavaScript libraries to create highly customizable and dynamic charts, JavaScript to perform operations on the data such as mapping, filtering, sorting, and parsing the JSON dataset to select the specific data in order to build different types of interactive charts, build a drop-down menu, create the plots, and deploy the code, HTML to create the web page and CSS to stylize the web page design. 

# Results

Below is an example of the dynamic dashboard with three types of charts: Bar, Bauge, and Bubble charts. Each chart is interactive based on the data selected in the drop-down menu. To inspect the data, end-users can select a specific test subject ID in the drop-down menu. Depending on the selection criteria, the Demographic Information panel will display metadata about the individaul test subject ID and the charts will dynamically display the results.
